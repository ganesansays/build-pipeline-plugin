# Build Pipeline Plugin #

## We HAVE MOVED TO GITHUB ##

https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-pipeline-plugin

Initially we moved to Google Code and attempted to support both Hudson and Jenkins.   What we have found though is that the vast majority of users have Jenkins.

So, we have moved back to the Jenkins ecosystem on **April 23rd 2013**.   Unfortunately we won't be able to bring the issues across, so we will leave them here for reference..

_Hopefully this will lead to some more contributions from the great Jenkins community_

## We need your help! ##

Details of how you can contribute and make this plugin better for everyone are available here:
